            If you are using class for a certain element, in the CSS file we use ".class_name" to style it.
            <br>
            If you are using id for a certain element, in the CSS file we use "#class_name" to style it.
            <br>
            If we are using element name to style, the syle will be applied to everyone of the elements.
